‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

### Steps to Run the Weather Application

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Weather_Application.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the backend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set up Redis**  
   Make sure Redis is installed and running on your machine. If you don't have Redis installed, you can follow the installation instructions from the official Redis website: [Redis Installation](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/).

   - If you‚Äôre using Docker, you can run Redis with the following command:
   
     ```bash
     docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
     ```

5. **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The backend will now connect to Redis for caching weather data.

6. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

7. **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

8. **Start the frontend server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Notes on Redis:

- Redis is used for caching API responses to speed up repeated queries and reduce the load on the OpenWeather API.
- By default, Redis will be running on port `6379` unless otherwise configured.
